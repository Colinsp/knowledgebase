A very simple WordPress plugin to create a Knowledgebase or FAQ.

== Description ==

As the name suggests, [Knowledgebase](https://github.com/WebberZone/knowledgebase) will allow you to create a simple Knowledgebase on your WordPress blog.

I felt the need to write up this simple plugin after I tried several free plugins out there, but none seemed to fit my purpose. In the spirit of open source, I'm releasing this to everyone who might find it useful.

Main features:

* Uses a custom post type `wz_knowledgebase` with a slug of `wzkb` ensuring your data always stays even if you choose to delete this plugin
* Uses Categories ( `kbcategory` ) to automatically draw up the knowledgebase
* Additionally tags ( `kbtags` ) can also be used for each knowledgebase article
* Shortcode `[[knowledgebase]]` will allow you to display the knowledgebase on any page of your choosing. I prefer creating one with the slug `knowledgebase`
* Inbuilt styles to display the knowledge beautifully

There are still many features that can go into this plugin. Got an idea? Then you can [create an issue on the Github page](https://github.com/WebberZone/knowledgebase/issues).

== Installation ==

1. Upload `knowledgebase` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Create a new page or edit an existing one and add `[knowledgebase]` to make it show on your site
